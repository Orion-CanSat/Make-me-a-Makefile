# Make me a Makefile
## What is Make me a Makefile?
Make me a Makefile (MAM) is a script written in PowerShell, that allows you to create a custom GNU Makefile for your embedded project.

&nbsp;
## Why use Make me a Makefile?
MAM is a free and open source cross platform solution that is capable of supporting many different architectures and proccesors. In addition, it is capable to make you a makefile for your regular project. And last but not least, it is even capable of compiling your own custom kernel. We are constantly working on adding more features, processor types, pre-made boards and architectures.

&nbsp;
## Architectures and pre-made boards we support and will support
### Architectures
- [x] ARM
- [ ] AVR
- [ ] x86

&nbsp;

- [ ] Arduino UNO, Nano, Mega
- [ ] ESP


## What if my platform is not supported, I don't use a pre-made board or my board is not supported?
You can still use our script but, you will have to provide some info about your board. You can also add an issue in our repository and ask for your pre-made board or architecture to be added.
